There are packages available for delphi and lazarus (*.dpk and *.lpk respectively).
Some users may prefer just installing as components.
When compiling using crosskylix make sure this library is in your path.

Install as package:
* Select File - Open
* Browse to the libsql.[l|d]pk package
* Compile and install

Install as components:
* Choose 'Install Component' from the main menu (Component)
* Select libsql.pas //(* 'sqlcomponents.pas' obsoleted, lazarus generated libsql.pas should work on win32 *)
* Install them.

Add the path to your envirenment variables (library path):
* (Delphi) Tools - Environment Options - (Tabsheet) Library - (Edit) Library path - (Button) ..
